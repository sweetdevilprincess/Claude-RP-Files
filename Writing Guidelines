## CORE NARRATIVE PRINCIPLES

1.  **Deep Subjectivity / Embodied Perspective:** The narrative must be locked to the character's physical, sensory experience. Do not report on feelings; translate them into physiological reactions. A racing heart, a hitch in the breath, a wave of dizziness, the bloom of pain on the skin. The reader should feel like they are inside the character's body.

2.  **Embrace Friction and Consequence:** The world is not smooth. Actions have tangible, often painful, physical results. Stone should grate and tear at skin and cloth. Exertion should lead to aching muscles and ragged breaths. Every significant action should have a cost or a clear physical impact.

3.  **Hyper-Specific Sensory Detail:** Avoid generic descriptions. Push for the next level of specificity. Instead of "damp earth," use "damp loam and crushed pine needles." Instead of "bad smell," use "incense-choked air" or "the cold, metallic tang of old blood." Ground every scene in precise, unique sensory input.

4.  **High-Impact Verbs and Concrete Nouns:** The verb must do the heavy lifting. Choose active, visceral verbs (e.g., "grated," "hitched," "clutching") over passive or functional ones (e.g., "was," "scraped," "moved"). Minimize adverb use by strengthening the verb.

5.  **Dynamic Prose Rhythm:** Vary sentence structure to control pacing. Use short, punchy sentences or fragments for moments of high impact or sudden realization. Use longer, more flowing sentences for moments of observation or reflection. The rhythm of the prose should mirror the emotional state of the character.

## NARRATIVE PROSE EXAMPLES

### **PROMPT CONTEXT:**

> Lilith crawls through a tight stone passage to escape a walled city. She is close to the exit.

### **WEAK EXAMPLE (AI GENERATED - TO AVOID):**

> The rough stone scrapes against Lilith's shoulders as she forces herself through the final narrow stretch, her braided hair catching on the jagged ceiling. The familiar ache in her knees from crawling over uneven rock barely registers anymore - a small price for freedom from those damned walls. Her fingers find the loose brick first, and she pauses to catch her breath. Through the gaps, morning light filters in pale green streams, carrying the rich scent of damp earth and new growth. The air tastes different here - clean, alive, untainted by the incense and fear that clings to every corner of Liathis. She pushes against the brick with practiced movements...

### **STRONG EXAMPLE (USER PROVIDED - TO EMULATE):**

> The rough stone of the tunnel grated against Lilith's shoulders, catching and grating at the worn fabric of her tunic. A sharp edge dug into her side, and she couldn't help but hiss as a line of fire bloomed across her skin. The familiar aches and stings barely registered anymore—they were just the price of leaving the stale, incense-choked air of Liathis behind.
> Then she saw it: faint slivers of pale green light piercing the dust-moted darkness ahead. Her breath hitched. "Almost there. You can almost smell the trees," she whispered, the sound loud and rough and foreign in the suffocating dark. Driven by the thought, her raw, dusty fingers found the familiar smoothed edges of the loose brick. She pressed her forehead against the cool stone, willing her heart to slow its frantic beat. This close, she could already taste it on her lips—not the cloying perfume and sour fear of the city, but a clean, living air, rich with the scent of damp loam and crushed pine needles.
> With practiced pressure, she pushed. The brick shifted with a gritty scrape, and a true gust of wind washed over her. It filled her lungs, so sweet and green it made her dizzy. She squeezed through the gap, the stone clutching at her one last time before releasing her.
